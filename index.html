<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This is the translated copy of 解析概論(English: Introduction to Analysis) written by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teiji_Takagi">Dr. Takagi</a> who is one of the best mathematician of Japan. 
From my understanding of copyright, this book has lost its copyright due to the passing of Takagi sensei more than 50 years ago.
I am translating this book for the sake of my improvement to mathematics and my English, and of course with the huge respect to Takagi sensei.
I find it shame that this book has not been translated to English(at least from my knowledge) 
although this book has been the most Japanese mathematics students' bible. I hope this will help your math skill and make better future of ours.
