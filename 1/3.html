<h2>Sets of numbers</h2>
<p>
Sets are the all of numbers which matches given specific circumstances. All numbers satisfies given circumstances belongs to set,
and others which does not satisfies does not belong to it. Any numbers has to be one of these two. Here are the examples of sets.
<ol>
	<li>Set of all rational numbers. Being qualified to be in it is to be rational number.</li>
	<li>For given constants \(a,b\), when \(a < b\), set of all \(x\) which is \(a \le x \le b\). This kind of sets are said to be <b>closed interval</b>.</li>
	<li>For given constants \(a,b\), when \(a < b\), set of all \(x\) which is \(a < x < b\). This kind of sets are said to be <b>open interval</b>.</li>
	<li>Set of rational numbers \(x\) which satisfies \(x^2 < 2\). (This means it is set of all x satisfies it)</li>
	<li>Set of positive rational numbers \(x\) which satisfies \(x^2 > 2\).</li>
	<li>For given function \(f(x)\)(such as polynomial), with for given number \(a,b\), set of \(x\) that is \(a < f(x) < b\).</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
When all numbers belong to set \(S\) are all less(or greater) than one number \(M\), \(S\) is said to be <b>bounded from above</b>(or <b>bounded from below</b>).
And M is called <b>upper bound</b>(or <b>lower bound</b>). If \(S\) is both bounded from above and below, then \(S\) is simply called bounded set.
