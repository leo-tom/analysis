    <title>Sets of numbers</title>

<body class="ALL">
<h2>Sets of numbers</h2>
<p>
Sets are the all of numbers which matches given specific circumstances. All numbers belongs to set satisfies given circumstances,
and others which does not satisfies does not belong to it. Any numbers has to be one of these two. Here are the examples of sets.
<ol>
	<li>Set of all rational numbers. Being qualified to be in it is to be rational number.</li>
	<li>For given constants \(a,b\), when \(a < b\), set of all \(x\) which is \(a \le x \le b\). This kind of sets are said to be <b>closed interval</b>.</li>
	<li>For given constants \(a,b\), when \(a < b\), set of all \(x\) which is \(a < x < b\). This kind of sets are said to be <b>open interval</b>.</li>
	<li>Set of rational numbers \(x\) which satisfies \(x^2 < 2\). (This means it is set of all x satisfies it)</li>
	<li>Set of positive rational numbers \(x\) which satisfies \(x^2 > 2\).</li>
	<li>For given function \(f(x)\)(such as polynomial), with for given number \(a,b\), set of \(x\) that is \(a < f(x) < b\).</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
When all numbers belong to set \(S\) are all less(or greater) than one number \(M\), \(S\) is said to be <b>bounded from above</b>(or <b>bounded from below</b>).
And M is called <b>upper bound</b>(or <b>lower bound</b>). If \(S\) is both bounded from above and below, then \(S\) is simply called bounded set.
</p>
<p>
There are several of upper bound. and lower bounds for given set \(S\). All numbers greater than one upper bound are also upper bound of \(S\).
And also any number less than lower bound are also lower bound of its. We are most likely to be interested in upper bounds that is low as it can be
and lower bounds that is great as it can be. If \(S\) has the maximal number, then that is lowest upper bound of it. If \(S\) have minimal value,
then that is the highest lower bound of it.
Now, as following proof suggests, if \(S\) is finite, even if there is no maximal value or minimal value in \(S\), lowest upper bound and greatest
lower bound of \(S\) always exits. These two are named upper limit and lower limit. These are not always element of \(S\). If \(S\) does not
have the maximal value, then upper limit of \(S\) does not belong to \(S\).
</p>
<p>
Again, \(a\), the upper limit of \(S\) is defined as follows.
<ol>
	<li>For <b>all</b> \(x \in S \), \(x \le a\)</li>
	<li>When \( a' < a \), there <b>exists</b> \(x \in S\) that satisfies \(a' < x \).</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
First one is about \(a\) being upper bound of \(S\). Second one denote \(a\) being upper limit of \(S\). We can denote lower limit just by reversing
the signs of inequality.
</p>
<p>
First example shown above is not finite to neither up nor low.
</p>
<p>
Sets defined as second and third examples are both bounded from above and below, \(a\) is the lower limit, \(b\) is the upper limit. 
For second example, both upper limit and 
lower limit belongs to set, for third case however, both lower limit and upper limit do not belong to the set. 
</p>
<p>
Set in fourth example is finite, but without maximal value or minimal value, \(\sqrt{2}\) is the upper limit, \(-\sqrt{2}\) is the lower limit. 
</p>
<p>
Set in fifth example is not bounded from above, but is bounded from below, \(\sqrt{2}\) is the lower limit of it.
</p>
<p> 
Now, as we denoted the definition of upper limit and lower limit, we shall prove the existence of it.
</p>
<div class="theorem">
<h3>Theorem 2 : Weierstrass's theorem</h3>
<p>
If set of number \(S\) is bounded from above(or bounded from below), there exists upper limit(or lower limit) of \(S\).
</p>
</div>
<p>
First, we prove existence of lower limit supposing \(S\) is lower bounded.
</p>
<p>
Suppose \(a\) as one of lower bound of \(S\), any number less than \(a\) are also lower bound of \(S\). if we let all numbers which are lower
bounds of \(S\) in \(A\), and others to \(B\), we get a cut \((A,B)\). In fact, all numbers in \(B\) are the numbers not lower bound of \(S\),
meaning any of it are greater than any lower bounds, therefor, they are all greater than any of numbers belong to \(A\).
</p>
<p>
Say \(s\) is the number which is represented by this cut. Then, \(s\) is either \(A\)'s element and maximal value of \(A\), or \(B\)'s element
and minimal value of \(B\). But can \(s\) belong to \(B\)?
</p>
<p>
Suppose \(s\) belongs to \(B\), \(s\) is not lower bound of \(S\), there exist \(x\) which is smaller than \(s\), and yet belongs to \(S\),
that is to say \(x < s\).
</p>
<p>
Say \(b\) is a number between \(x\) and \(s\), that is, \(x < b < s\).
</p>
<p>
\(b\) is greater than \(x\) which belongs to \(S\), therefore, \(b\) is not lower bound of \(S\). Thus \(b\) belongs to \(b\), and \(b\) is
smaller than \(s\), this is clearly contradiction.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, \(s\) is not minimal value of \(B\).
</p>
<p>
That is to say, \(s\) is maximal value of \(A\), in other words, lower limit of \(S\).
</p>
<p>
When \(S\) is bounded from above, existence of upper limit is also proved same way.
