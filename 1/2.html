    <title>Continuity of numbers</title>

<body class="ALL">
<h2>Continuity of numbers</h2>
<p>
Concepts explained previous section are assumed to be well known, however, since continuity of numbers are basis of
analysis, it needs to be explained.
</p>
<p>
When all numbers are divided to 2 sets \(A,B\) such that all numbers in \(A\) are less than all of \(B\)'s, \((A,B)\)
is called Dedekind cut. \(A\) is called downward set, and \(B\) is called upward set.
</p>
<p>
It must be strict for any number to belong either of \(A\) or \(B\), and only one of \(A\) or \(B\).
</p>
<p>
Suppose for given arbitrary number \(s\), let all numbers less than \(s\) be in \(A\), all numbers greater than \(s\)
be in \(B\). To complete cut, \(s\) itself has to be in either \(A\) or \(B\). If we put \(s\) into \(A\), \(s\) is the
maximal number in \(A\), and \(B\) would not have the minimal number.
If we put \(s\) into \(B\), \(s\) is the minimal number in \(B\), and \(A\) would not have the maximal number.
As such, we get Dedekind cut of which boundary is \(s\). Now, what is important is the converse of it.
</p>
<div class="theorem">
<h3>Theorem 1.</h3>
<p>
An Dedekind cut \((A,B)\) represents one number as its boundary.
</p>
</div>
<p>
For a given cut \((A,B)\), there is a number \(s\) which is either \(A\)'s maximal value or \(B\)'s minimal value. For former case, \(B\)
would not have the minimal value, and for latter case, there is no maximal number in \(A\). Not as we discussed above, not just given
number \(s\) represents \((A,B)\), but when \((A,B)\) is given, \(s\) would be represented by it.
</p>
<p>
And that is what we call <b>Continuity of numbers</b>. As we suppose this theorem is approved, and basis of the theory gets constructed. 
</p>
<p>
If there is concept of less and greater, we can have a cut on that concept. Theoretically there are 3 type of possible cuts. That are, for \((A,B)\),
<ol>
	<li>\(A\) have maximal value and \(B\) also have minimal value. In other words, there is a leap between two.</li>
	<li>\(A\) have no maximal value and \(B\) also have no minimal value. In other words, there is a gap between two.</li>
	<li>Either of \(A\) or \(B\) have edge(maximal value or minimal value), and other one does not. In other words, these two are continuous.</li>
</ol> 
</p>
<p>
Third one is the only case of Dedekind cut's theorem. 
</p>
<p>
There is only the case of first one in integer system. In rational number, there is always one number between two different numbers(Compactness of rational number).
That means, in rational number's case, first case never occurs, but second case does. For instance, if we let all rational number \(b\) be
in the upper set \(B\) where \(b \ge \sqrt{2}\), and other rational numbers be in \(A\), although there is no rational number \(s = \sqrt{2}\), this is
indeed the cut, and is second case of it. This indicates that we are able to cut rational numbers without touching any of it(just \(\sqrt{2}\) which is
not rational number). It can be guessed that Dedekind was trying to show us this circumstance by using the word "cut"(Schnitt).
