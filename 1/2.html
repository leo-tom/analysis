<h2>Continuity of numbers</h2>
<p>
Concepts explained previous section are assumed to be well known, however, since continuity of numbers are basis of
analysis, it need to be explained.
</p>
<p>
When all numbers are divided to 2 sets \(A,B\) such that all numbers in \(A\) are less than all of \(B\)'s, \((A,B)\)
is called Dedekind cut. \(A\) is called downward set, and \(B\) is called upward set.
</p>
<p>
It must be strict for any number to belong either of \(A\) or \(B\), and only one of \(A\) or \(B\).
</p>
<p>
Suppose for given arbitrary number \(s\), let all numbers less than \(s\) be in \(A\), all numbers greater than \(s\)
be in \(B\). To complete cut, \(s\) itself has to be in either \(A\) or \(B\). If we put \(s\) into \(A\), \(s\) is the
maximal number in \(A\), and \(B\) would not have the minimal number.
If we put \(s\) into \(B\), \(s\) is the minimal number in \(B\), and \(A\) would not have the maximal number.
As such, we get Dedekind cut of which boundary is \(s\). Now, what is important is the converse of it.
</p>

<h3>Theorem 1.</h3>
<p>
An Dedekind cut \((A,B)\) determines one number as its boundary.
