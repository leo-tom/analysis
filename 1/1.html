<h2>Concept of numbers</h2>
<p>
Assume that basic concept of numbers such as 4 arithmetic operations are already known. At first few chapters, we only
deal with real numbers. Therefore, no specification would be given. Let's assume that following terms are already known.
<table style="margin: auto;" border="1">
<tr >
<td>Natural number</td>
<td>1,2,3,... They are used to rank or count set of things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>\(0,\pm 1,\pm 2...\) Natural number is equivalent to positive integer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rational number</td>
<td>0 and any number expressed with \(\pm\frac{a}{b}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are natural number. If \(b=1\), then it is integer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Irrational number</td>
<td>Real numbers except all Rational number. For example,<br>
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{2} &= 1.4142135..., \\
 e       &= 2.718281828..., \\
\pi      &= 3.1415926535..., 
\end{align*}
(Note that it requires to be proved that these are not rational number.)
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<h3>Decimal system</h3>
<p>
It is also well known that real numbers are expressed in decimal system. When rational number is expressed in decimal system,
it is expressed with either recurring decimal or finite decimal otherwise. However, any finite decimal can also be expressed in recurring
decimal. For instance \(0.6 = 0.5999...\). When irrational numbers are expressed in decimal system, do not terminate nor do they repeat.
</p>
<p>
We humans express numbers in decimal system probably because we have 10 fingers. But theoretically numbers can be expressed with 
base-\(n\) positional notation except the one where \(n=1\).
</p>
<p>
Specially, in binary system, we only need \(1\) and \(2\) to express numbers. Rational numbers recur except one with denominator which is
power of 2.For example,
\begin{align*}
\frac{5}{8} &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^3} = (0.101). \\
\frac{5}{8} &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \frac{1}{2^5} + ... = (0.10011...). \\
\frac{2}{3} &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \frac{1}{2^5} + ... = (0.101010...).
\end{align*}
</p>
<h3>Geometrical representation of numbers</h3>
<p>
Analysis uses terms from geometry. For instance, we express real numbers with point on the line using coordinates. We already know the way to do so.
On the line \(XX'\), point \(O\) which represents 0 is called origin. If point \(E\) represents 1 on line (\OX\), \(OE\) is the unit of the length.
Generally, point \(P\) represent \(x\) is on \(OX\) or \(OX'\) depending on whether \(x\) is positive or negative.
