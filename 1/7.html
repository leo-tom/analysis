<h2>Limit point</h2>
<p>
Set of points(topological space) is defined similarly as set of numbers. When every \(x_k\) of point \(P = (x_1,x_2,...x_n)\) are bounded, topological space
is said to be bounded. In this sense, all points in the set is within a limit that is finite. For instance, points always be in a interval if it is 1-dimensional,
points always be in a square if it is 2-dimensional.
</p>
<p>
Let \(S\) be a set; if there are infinitely many points of \(S\) closer and closer to \(A\), \(A\) is said to be <b>Limit point</b> of \(S\).
Note that it does not mean \(A\) belongs to \(S\).
</p>
<p style="font-size: small;">
Examples : 
<ol style="font-size: small;">
	<li>Let \(S\) be set of points \((x,y)\) such that, \(x,y\) are arbitrary rational numbers; then all points \((a,b)\) are limit points of \(S\).
		It is because no matter \(a\) or \(b\)	is rational or irrational, for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exist infinitely many \(x,y\)
		 such that, \(|x-a| < \varepsilon,|y-b| < \varepsilon\).
	</li>
	<li>Let \(m,n\) be arbitrary natural number, and let set of points \((\frac{1}{m},\frac{1}{n})\) be \(S\); 
	then \((\frac{1}{m},0),(0,\frac{1}{n}),(0,0)\) are limit points of \(S\). Generally, limit point of limit point is limit point. 
	</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p style="font-size: small;">
Let \(S\) be set of each items of \(\{a_n\}\), if same number \(a\) appears in \(\{a_n\}\) many times, \(a\) is unlikely limit point of \(S\).
By contrast, not appearing \(a\) many times in \(\{a_n\}\) is equivalent to : if \(\{a_n\}\) converges to \(a\), then \(S\) is bounded, and \(a\)
is only one limit point of \(S\). Furthermore in this case, \(\varlimsup a_n,\varliminf a_n\) are accordingly maximal and minimal limit point of \(S\).
