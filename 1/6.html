<h2>Necessary conditions for convergence : Cauchy's sequence</h2>

<div class="theorem">
<h3>Theorem 8</h3>
<p>
What is necessary and sufficient for sequence \(\{a_n\}\) to converge is : If for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists a \(n_0\)
such that,
\begin{equation}
	p > n_0, q > n_0 \mbox{ then }|a_p - a_q| < \varepsilon .
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
It is clear that the statement above is necessary : Say \(a_n \to \lambda \), from the definition of convergence; we can choose certain \(n_0\) such that
\begin{equation}
	p > n,q>n, |a_p - \lambda| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2},|a_p - \lambda| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} .
\end{equation} 
Thus \(|a_p -a_q| < \varepsilon\).
</p>
<p>
What is important is the sufficiency of statement. First, we can confirm that \(\{a_n\}\) is bounded. In fact, if we can choose \(\varepsilon\) 
according to one \(n_0\); when \(p > n_0\) : 
\begin{equation}
	|a_{n_0 + 1} - a_p| < \varepsilon, \\
	a_{n_0 + 1} - \varepsilon < a_p < a_{n_0 + 1} + \varepsilon .
\end{equation}
Thus, \(\{a_n\}\) is bounded for all \(n\) which are larger than \(n_0\). Since we chose appropriate \(n_0\), adding finite numbers \(a_1,a_2,...,a_n\) 
to \(\{a_n\}\) keeps it bounded.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, for arbitrary \(n_0\), take \(l_n,m_n\) as supremum and infimum of \(a_n,a_{n+1},...\); and let \(I_n = [l_n,m_n]\) then :
\begin{equation}
	m_1 \le m_2 \le ... \le m_n \le ..... \le l_n \le ... \le l_2 \le l_1 , \tag{1} \\
	I_1 \supset I_2 \supset ... \supset I_n \supset ... \mbox{ .}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p>
From the assumption, there exists \(n_0\) for all \(\varepsilon > 0\), when \(p > n_0,q > n_0\) :
\begin{equation}
	a_p - a_q < \varepsilon . 
\end{equation}
Thus, for all \(n > n_0\), from definition of supremum; \(l_n - a_q \le \varepsilon\) for arbitrary \(q \le n\). From definition of
infimum, 
\begin{equation}
l_n - m_n \le \varepsilon .
\end{equation}
From what we discussed on nested intervals, we know that there exists \(\lambda\) such that :
\begin{equation}
	l_n \to \lambda , m_n \to \lambda .
\end{equation}
Then, it has to be
\begin{equation}
	a_n \to \lambda .
\end{equation}
In fact, because \(a_n\) belongs to \([m_n,l_n]\); for sufficiently large \(n\) : 
\begin{equation}
	|a_n - \lambda | \le l_n - m_n \le \varepsilon
\end{equation}
</p>
<div style="text-align:right;">Q.E.D.</div>
</div>
<h3>Limit superior,Limit inferior</h3>
<p>
In the proof demonstrated above, (1) was demonstrated only using boundedness of \(\{a_n\}\).
Monotonic sequences \(\{l_n\},\{m_n\}\) in (1) converges. Say \(\lambda,\mu\) are limits of these, then \(\lambda\) is 
said to be limit superior(German: limes superior) of bounded sequence \(\{a_n\}\); that is denoted as 
\(\limsup_{n\to\infty} a_n\), or \(\varlimsup_{n\to\infty} a_n\). Similarly, we call \(\mu\) limit inferior(German: limes inferior)
 of \(\{a_n\}\); and denote it 
\(\liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n\), or \(\varliminf_{n\to\infty} a_n\).
As such, bounded sequences \(\{a_n\}\) would always have limit superior \(\lambda\) and limit inferior \(\mu\), and they are \(\lambda \le \mu\).
Sequences converge if and only if they are same value : 
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lambda = \mu .
\end{equation} 
</p>
<p>
<ol type="I">
	<li>To be limit superior \(\lambda\) requires followings : </li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li>With \(\lambda + \varepsilon\) which is greater than \(\lambda\), \(a_n < \lambda + \varepsilon\) for sufficiently large \(n\).</li>
		<li>With \(\lambda - \varepsilon\) which is less than \(\lambda\), there exist infinite number of \(n\) such that \(\lambda - \varepsilon < a_n\). </li>
	</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
In fact, from the definition of \(\lambda\), \(l_n < \lambda + \varepsilon\) for sufficiently large \(n\), thus \(a_n \le l_n \le \lambda + \varepsilon\).
That is what (i) claims. Additionally, as \(l_p\) being superior of \(a_p,a_{p+1},...\); for arbitrary \(p\) there exists \(a_n\) such that
\(\lambda -\varepsilon \le l_p - \varepsilon < a_n,n \le p\). Because \(p\) is arbitrary chosen, infinitely many \(a_n\) exists.
That is what (ii) claims.
</p>
<p>
We can describe (a) and (b) differently : 
<ol type="I" start="2">
	<li>There exist infinite number of \(a_n\) close to \(\lambda\). However, if we take \(\lambda' > \lambda\), there do not.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Or : 
<ol type="I" start="3">
	<li>There exists a partial sequence of \(\{a_n\}\) that converges to \(\lambda\), however, there is none of which converges to \(\lambda'\) which is
		larger than \(\lambda\). We call \(\lambda\) limit superior of \(\{a_n\}\), to indicate this characteristics.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
For limit inferior, you simply need to invert magnitude relationships in (a),(b),(c). 
</p>
<p>
In practical use, it is convenient to define limit superior and limit inferior for non-bounded sequences.
To refer it simpler, we allow use of \(+\infty , -\infty\) in (c). That are to say :
<ul>
	<li>\( \{a_n\} \mbox{ is not bounded from above.} \Rightarrow \varlimsup a_n = + \infty \)</li>
	<li>\( \{a_n\} \mbox{ is not bounded from below.} \Rightarrow \varliminf a_n = - \infty \)</li>
	<li>
	\(\{a_n\} \mbox{ is bounded from above, but is not bounded from below.} \)
	 \( \Rightarrow \varliminf a_n = \lambda \mbox{ if } l_n \to \lambda , \varlimsup a_n = - \infty \mbox{ if } l_n \to - \infty . \)
	 \( \mbox{It goes same when } \{a_n\}\) is bounded from below, but is not bounded from above.
	 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Including \(\pm \infty\), arbitrary sequence \(\{a_n\}\) has both \(\varlimsup a_n\) and \(\varliminf a_n \).
When they are equal, \(\{a_n\}\) has its limit.
</p>
<p style="font-size: small;">
Examples : 
<ol type="1" style="font-size: small;">
	<li>\(a_n = \frac{(-1)^n n+1}{n} \Rightarrow \varlimsup a_n = 1,\varliminf a_n = -1\)</li>
	<li>\(a_{2n} = 1 + \frac{(-1)^n}{n} , a_{2n+1} = \frac{(-1)^n}{n} \Rightarrow \varlimsup a_n = 1,\varliminf a_n = 0.\)
			This sequence looks like \(-1,0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},...\). There are several items which are greater than 
			\(1\), and ones which are less than \(0\).
	</li>
	<li>\(a_n = (-1)^n n \Rightarrow \varlimsup a_n = + \infty,\varliminf a_n = - \infty\)</li>
	<li>\(a_n = \cos n \alpha \mbox{(choose \(\alpha\) such that \(\pi / \alpha \) is irrational)} \Rightarrow \varlimsup a_n = 1,\varliminf a_n = -1\). 
			It is difficult to prove it. First, take irrational \(\alpha / \pi \). Take arbitrary point \(A\)	on circumference of the unit circle. 
			Take point \(P_n\) on circumference of the unit circle, such that length of arc \(A P_n\) is \(n \alpha\).
	</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Sequence in higher dimension</h3>
<p>
If we take points \(P_n = (x_{1n},x_{2n},...x_{mn}) \) with natural number \(n,m\),
sequence of points in m-dimensional space \(\{P_n\}\) can also be defined similarly as 1-dimensional sequence.
</p>
<p>
Limit of \(\{P_n\}\) is a point in m-dimensional space \((a_1,a_2,...,a_m)\) such that : 
If for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists sufficiently large \(n_0\) such that, if \(n > n_0\), then \(A P_n < \varepsilon\).
If and only if the above statement is satisfied, \(\{P_n\}\) converges to \(A\).
</p>
<p style="font-size: small;">
Distance \(A P_m\) is defined as \(\sqrt{(a_1 - x_{1n})^2 + (a_2 - x_{2n})^2 + ... + (a_n - x_{mn})^2 }\). If it is less than \(\varepsilon\), 
then \(|a - x_n| < \varepsilon , |a - x_{2n}| < \varepsilon , ... ,|a - x_{mn}| < \varepsilon\). Namely, \(AP_n < m\varepsilon\). Hence \(P_n \to A \) is equivalent to
\begin{align}
	\lim_{n \to \infty} x_{1n} = a_1 , \lim_{n \to \infty} x_{2n} = a_2 , ... , \lim_{n \to \infty} x_{mn} = a_m .
\end{align}
</p>
<p>
Finally, we get generalisation of Cauchy's sequence.
<div class="theorem">
<h3>Theorem 8</h3>
<p>
What is necessary and sufficient for sequence of points \(\{P_n\}\) to converge is : If for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists a \(n_0\)
such that,
\begin{equation}
	p > n_0, q > n_0 \mbox{ then }P_p P_q < \varepsilon .
\end{equation}
