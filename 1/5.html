<h2>Nested intervals</h2>
<div class="theorem">
<h3>Theorem 7 : </h3>
<p>
 For closed interval \(I_n = [a_n,b_n](n=1,2,...)\),
<ol>
	<li>Every interval \(I_n\) is included in \(I_{n+1}\),</li>
	<li>With infinitely increasing \(n\), \(b_n - a_n\) diminishes without limit,</li>
</ol>
then there exists only one point that is common with every \(I_n\).
</p>
</div>

<p>
 Such intervals are named <b>Nested interval</b>. They can be used to confirm a number.
</p>

<div class="proof">
<p>
 From first assumption,
\begin{equation}
	a_1 \le a_2 \le ... \le a_m \le ... \le b_n \le ... \le b_2 \le b_1 .
\end{equation}
Therefore, both \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\{b_n\}\) are monotonic, and are bounded. Then, from theorem 6, there exists \(\alpha , \beta \) such that
\begin{equation}
	\lim a_n = \alpha , \lim b_n = \beta .
\end{equation}
Because \(a_n < b_n\) for arbitrary \(m,n\), when \(n \to \infty \), \(\alpha < b_m\). Hence when \(m \to \infty\), \(\alpha \le \beta\).
</p>

<p>
 From second assumption, for arbitrary \(\varepsilon > 0\), there exist \(n\) such that
\begin{equation}
	b_n - a_n < \varepsilon .
\end{equation}
From
\begin{equation}
	a_n \le \alpha \le \beta \le b_n ,
\end{equation}
we can rewrite it as
\begin{equation}
	0 \le \beta - \alpha < \varepsilon .
\end{equation}
\(\varepsilon\) is arbitrary chosen, hence \(\alpha = \beta\).
</p>
<p>
Considering that \(a_n \le \alpha \le b_n\) for arbitrary \(n\), \(\alpha\) belongs to each intervals \(I_n\).
From second assumption, it is clear that there is no other number that belongs to every intervals except \(\alpha\).
</p>
<div style="text-align:right;">Q.E.D.</div>
</div>

<p style="font-size: small;">
In this theorem, we defined \(I_n\) as closed interval to make both ends \(a_n , b_n\) of \(I_n\) to be in \(I_n\).
Note that this assumption is necessary. Because \(\alpha\) does not always belongs to open interval \((a_n,b_n)\),
the above proof without defining \(I_n\) as closed interval would not work. In fact, if left-hand end(or right-hand end) of interval is 
always same, then that point is \(\alpha\) itself.
</p>

 We have looked into 4 basic theorems of continuity of real numbers. That are:
<ol type="I">
	<li>Dedekind's theorem(Theorem 1)</li>
	<li>Weierstrass's theorem(Existence of supremum and infimum, Theorem 2)</li>
	<li>Convergent of bounded monotonic sequences(Theorem 6)</li>
	<li>Nested intervals(Theorem 7)</li>
</ol>
We used I like as axiom to prove II, and used II to prove III, and III to prove IV. But actually, these are all equivalent.
Meaning that by confirming just one of these, other theorems can be showed by it. To prove it, we simply have to assume IV, and prove 
I from it.

Say \((A,B)\) is a cut of real number. Our aim is to prove existence of maximal value in downward set \(A\), or to prove existence 
of minimal value in upward set \(B\) using theorem 7. Note that we only need to prove existence of either of them.
</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Now, we take arbitrary number \(a,b\) from \(A,B\), and name interval \([a,b]\) as \(I_0\). Consider \(\frac{a+b}{2}\), it has to be at between
\(a\) and \(b\), and has to belong either \(A\) or \(B\). If we denote \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) according to whether \(\frac{a+b}{2}\) belongs to
\(A\) or \(B\) as follows : 
\begin{equation}
	a_1 = \frac{a+b}{2}, b_1 = b \mbox{ or } a_1 = a , b_1 = \frac{a+b}{2} ,
\end{equation}
we get interval \(I_1 = [a_1,b_1]\) whose left end belongs to \(A\), right end belongs to \(B\). 
\(I_1 \) be either half-left of \(I_0\) or half-right of \(I_0\), and its size be \(b_2 - a_2 = \frac{1}{2}(b-a)\).
By continuing such a process, we get sequence of intervals :
\begin{equation}
	I_0 \supset I_1 \supset I_2 \supset ... \supset I_n \supset ... *, \\
	I_n = [a_n,b_n], b_n - a_n = \frac{1}{2^n}(b-a) .
\end{equation}
Notice Theorem 7 can be applied to this sequence, if we take \(s\) which conforms Theorem 7, it has to belong to either upward set or downward set.
</p>
<p>
Let \(s \in A\). If we take \(s'\) where \(s < s'\), there exists \(b_n\) such that \(s < b_n < s'\) since \(b_n \to s\).
Therefore, \(s'\) belongs to \(B\), that is, \(s\) belongs to \(A\); and all \(s'\) that is greater than \(s'\) all belong to \(B\).
In other words, \(s\) is the maximum value of \(A\). In this circumstances, \(B\) would not have minimal value.
If we claim that \(s'\) is \(B\)'s minimum value : \(s < s'\), so there exists \(b_n\) such that \(b_n < s'\). But \(b_n\) belongs to \(B\), 
so, that is contradiction.
</p>
<p>
If \(s\in B\), we can demonstrate that \(s\) is minimal value of \(B\), and \(A\) has no maximal value of it; similarly as we did.
</p>

<p>
Thus, Dedekind's theorem is now proven by only using the Theorem 7.
