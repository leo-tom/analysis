<h1>Basic concepts</h1>
<p>
There is something that making me unable to sleep at night(so that I sleep in daytime). In English, uncountable words such as
water, money and fish does not be plural, meaning we don't say "I eat fishes." or "Many money". What about numbers then?
Integers in appropriate interval has to be able to be plural since elements inside is finite. But Real number(s) in arbitrary interval
is infinite. Therefore, it is not countable, thus it cannot be plural. Set of all natural number(s) is infinite, but it can be counted by
natural number(s).
